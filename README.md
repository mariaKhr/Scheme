# Scheme interpreter

This is an interpreter implementation for a LISP-like programming language, exactly for some subset of [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/).

The language consists of:
- Primitive types: integers, bools, and symbols.
- Composite types: pairs and lists.
- Variables with syntaxscope.
- Functions and lambda expressions.
